👋 Hi, I'm Sayanth T M from Kannur, Kerala.

👀 I'm interested in mobile app development and web development.

🌱 Currently learning React and mastering Python.

🎯 Proficient in basic C and Java programming, with a focus on continuous improvement.

💞️ Looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to mobile app or web development.

📚 When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost in books, watching movies, or enjoying music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/200iwi2ev4ilm139cwlqja6ns).
